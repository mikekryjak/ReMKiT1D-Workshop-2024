    "In this session we cover the basics of CRM construction for use in ReMKiT1D models. The example is focused on a small set of equations, in order to demonstrate the general concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrated concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting species and associating variables to them \n",
    "- Simple and derived transitions \n",
    "- Constructing CRM modelbound data from transitions\n",
    "- Adding term generators that use CRM modelbound data\n",
    "- The extractor manipulator\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of CRM concepts is beyond this workshop. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kinetic features - Boltzmann term generators \n",
    "- Built-in Janev hydrogen transitions \n",
    "- Using external databases such as AMJUEL to construct polynomial fits \n",
    "- Other kinds of transitions (detailed balance etc.)"

This is assumption can be relaxed, but required the evolution of electron energy and unduly complicated this system."
