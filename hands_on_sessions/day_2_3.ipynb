    "- Adding term generators that use CRM modelbound data\n",
    "- The extractor manipulator\n",

    "where $h\\nu$ signifies a photon with the transition energy. We will assume that any energy losses are recuperated through some heating of the electrons, maintaining a constant electron temperature. This is assumption can be relaxed, but required the evolution of electron energy and unduly complicated this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system described above can be represented with the following system of nonlinear ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d n_1}{dt} = -K_{12}n_en_1 - K_1^{ion}n_en_1 + A_{21}n_2 + K_1^{rec}n_e^2n_i $$\n",
