    "\n",
    "In this session we cover the basics of CRM construction for use in ReMKiT1D models. The example is focused on a small set of equations, in order to demonstrate the general concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrated concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting species and associating variables to them \n",
    "- Simple and derived transitions \n",
    "- Constructing CRM modelbound data from transitions\n",
    "- Adding term generators that use CRM modelbound data\n",
    "- The extractor manipulator\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of CRM concepts is beyond this workshop. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kinetic features - Boltzmann term generators \n",
    "- Built-in Janev hydrogen transitions \n",
    "- Using external databases such as AMJUEL to construct polynomial fits \n",
    "- Other kinds of transitions (detailed balance etc.)"

    "Let's write a simplified nonlinear time-dependent CRM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we're working with electrons, singly-charged ions, a ground state and an excited neutral state. This implies that we are tracking the following densities:\n",

    "$$n_e,n_i,n_1,n_2$$\n",

    "$$ i + e + e \\rightarrow b + e,\\quad b=1,2$$  \n",

    "- Electron impact excitation from state 1 to state 2\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e + 1 \\rightarrow e + 2$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Radiative de-excitation (spontaneous emission) from state 2 to state 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n_2 \\rightarrow n_1 + h\\nu$$ \n",
    "where $h\\nu$ signifies a photon with the transition energy. We will assume that any energy losses are recuperated through some heating of the electrons, maintaining a constant electron temperature. This is assumption can be relaxed, but required the evolution of electron energy and unduly complicated this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system described above can be represented with the following system of nonlinear ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d n_1}{dt} = -K_{12}n_en_1 - K_1^{ion}n_en_1 + A_{21}n_2 + K_1^{rec}n_e^2n_i $$\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, one could simplify the system by dropping the ion density equation, but in we might want to track many different ionization states so $n_e \\neq n_i$ in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we have only 6 reactions, the number of terms (ignoring potentially simplifying groupings) in this system is 16. The CRM features in ReMKiT1D are meant to simplify the building of many related terms, such as these. "
